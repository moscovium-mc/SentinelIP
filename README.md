***Status: In development***

**SentinelIP** is a real-time IP threat detection service that combines proxy & VPN detection with IP threat intelligence to protect against malicious traffic. It helps identify suspicious IPs, mitigate fraud, and block bot attacks for web applications and APIs.

## Features

- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Detect and flag malicious IP addresses in real-time.
- **Proxy & VPN Detection**: Identify users accessing through proxies or VPNs.
- **IP Threat Intelligence**: Use known threat intelligence to block malicious traffic.
- **API Integration**: Easily integrate with your web applications or APIs for automatic threat detection.

## Installation
